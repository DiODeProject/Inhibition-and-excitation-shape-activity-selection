The content in the file "InterneuronInhibitionModel_MatCont.m" details the model definition as used 
in the bifurcation analysis performed with MatCont in Matlab.
This was used in conjunction with the simulations
to obtain bifurcation points of the model with the artificial nonlinearity 
(integration with x_i=max(x_i,0) at each timestep to avoid negative motivations).
All bifurcation points can be reproduced in MatCont using this model definition
and then working interactively with the tool.
All amplitudes plotted in Figs.3 and 5 were obtained from comprehensive numerical
simulations that can be found in the respective folders.
