The content in the file "InterneuronInhibitionModel_MatCont.m" details the model definition as used 
in the bifurcation study performed with MatCont in Matlab.
This was the basis for our bifurcation study and all bifurcation diagrams produced.
All bifurcation diagrams can be reproduced in MatCont using this model definition
and then working interactively with the tool.

We exported all bifurcation curves generated in MatCont and plotted the results with 
Matplotlib in Python code.
The exported data files can be found in the subfolders 
"MainPaper/DataFilesFromMatCont" and "SupplementaryMaterial/DataFilesFromMatCont".
Code to plot the bifiurcation diagrams is in the folders
"MainPaper" and "SupplementaryMaterial".
